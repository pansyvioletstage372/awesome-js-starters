## The Problem

Displaying Markdown content as rendered HTML on a web page is often a complex task that requires writing intricate parsing logic or dealing with edge cases in text formatting. For developers who want to allow users to write in a simple, human-readable format, the technical hurdle of converting that input into valid, safe, and well-structured HTML can be a significant bottleneck if they have to build the transformation engine from scratch.
