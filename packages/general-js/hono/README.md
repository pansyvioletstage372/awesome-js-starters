## The Problem

Finding a web framework that balances simplicity with power is a frequent challenge, as many feature-rich options come with a steep learning curve and heavy overhead. Developers often need a tool that is intuitive enough to learn in an afternoon while remaining robust enough to handle production-grade requirements. Furthermore, as infrastructure shifts toward the edge, there is a critical need for frameworks specifically optimized for environments like Cloudflare Workers, where traditional, bulkier frameworks often struggle with performance bottlenecks and slow startup times.

## What It Does

Hono addresses these challenges by providing a "dead simple" API that feels familiar and easy to master without sacrificing essential functionality. It is engineered specifically for speed and a tiny footprint, making it the ideal choice for edge computing environments where performance is non-negotiable. By leveraging a highly optimized router and native web standards, Hono ensures your applications run with lightning-fast response times globally, solving the problem of performance lag while maintaining an exceptionally clean and approachable development experience.

## Usage Example

Use this minimum snippet to start a server :

```js
import { Hono } from "hono";

const app = new Hono();

  return c.text("Hello Hono!");
});

export default app;
```

By default, the server will be accessible on `http://localhost:8787`.
